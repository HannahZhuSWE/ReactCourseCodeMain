When you click the toggle persons button the person cards will appear/disappear\
When you type in the input fields of the person cards the name will update\
If you click on the paragraph that displays the person's name the corresponding person card will disappear\
There's a one time alert from localhost 3000 at the very begining (was testing useEffect)\
If you click on the remove cockpit button everything below the button but above the person cards will also disappear\
